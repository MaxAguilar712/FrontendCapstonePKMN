**POCKET MONSTERS PACK SIMULATOR** is a web app developed in React.js along with HTML5, CSS3, and JSON Server.
PM Pack Sim provides users with the joy of collecting Trading Cards. The App uses an API containing over 400 unique cards, as well as a database of the users cards. One page allows the user open booster packs containing (these are randomly pulled from a chosen set of cards). While some card packs are still available at the average retail store, some card packs have nearly been lost to history for almost 25 years. This app allows users to simulate the experience of opening and collecting cards that they may have not had the opportunity to collect in real life. One of the primary reasons I wanted to develop this web app was to relive fun childhood memories of opening booster packs and the joy that came with pulling rare and flashy looking cards. I hope this app provides a similar positive experience to other people.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
